<p>These essays—thumbnail sketches
of Cape Cod—should not be taken as
a serious attempt to describe the Cape
or to delineate its people. They merely
express a perennial enthusiasm for
this summer holiday land, to-day the
playground of thousands of Americans,
three hundred years ago the first
“land of the free and home of the
brave.”</p>

<h1><i>CAPE-CODDITIES</i></h1>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="I">I<br />
<span class="smaller">A MESSAGE FROM THE PAST</span></h2>

</div>

<p>Is it not strange that people who
dwell in the same city block from
October to May, enjoying with mutual
satisfaction the life which touches
them equally, should from May to
October show such varying opinions
that argument is futile? These people
who have wintered so happily together<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[2]</span>
may be placed in three classes—those
who claim for the State of
Maine the exclusive right to the title
of “God’s Own Country,” those who
think of the North Shore and Paradise
as synonymous, and those other
fortunates whose regard for Cape
Cod places it second only to heaven
itself.</p>

<p>Therefore, it is interesting to read
the following passages and to find
these same divergent views of the
Cape in earliest times.</p>

<p>Captain John Smith in his account
of New England in 1614, in a passing
reference to Cape Cod, says it
“is a headland of high hills of sand
overgrown with shrubbie pines, hurts<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>[3]</span>
and such trash, but an excellent harbor
for all weathers. This cape is
made by the maine sea on one side
and a great bay on the other, in the
form of a sickle. On it doth inhabit
the people of Pawmet and in the
Bottome of the Bay, the people of
Chawum.” Scant praise.</p>

<p>Bartholomew Gosnold, writing to
Raleigh in 1602, through the medium
of his associate, John Brereton, said,
“We stood a while like men ravished
at the beautie and delicacie of
this sweet soil”; and later, “truly the
holsomnese and temperature of this
climat doth not only argue this people
(Indian) to be answerable to this description,
but also of a perfect constitution<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
of body, active, strong, healthful
and very wittie.”</p>

<p>Here spoke the original summer
visitor and the founder of that colony
which dots the coast from Marion to
Manomet.</p>

<p>If Gosnold could see the Cape on
the present day, he would doubtless
show profound disappointment, unless
he had chanced to invest in shore property,
for the forests teeming with game
have disappeared, and no trace of the
wit he describes can be detected among
the few Indians who still cling to the
shores of Mashpee Pond. But the broad
waters, the sloping sands, and above
all the soft climate which Mr. Brereton
tells us did so much for the aborigine,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
and which now transforms our children
into veritable little red men, remain.</p>

<p>Despite the depredations which the
Cape has suffered at the hands of both
natives and summer residents, its flavor
has been maintained, and the very fact
that it is largely inhabited serves well
in these days of friendly intercourse
and indulgent habits; for we all of us
must live happily in summer, and to
do so means comfort, food, and drink.
And so we find each town, however
diminutive, possesses its Butcher and
Baker and Candlestick-Maker.</p>

<p>The latter, to be sure, is employed
by the local electric light plant, and
often his trade includes a knowledge
of simple plumbing. The Baker more<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
often is both Postmaster and Grocer,
while the Butcher may be found to be
the Chairman of the Board of Selectmen.
But all are true to the type, and
that wit which Gosnold so happily
mentions may often be detected among
these simple people, some of whom
are sea captains whose taciturnity has
been transformed into a shrewd cynicism
coupled not infrequently with
a delightful optimism. Rarely will a
native Cape-Codder get the worst of
a repartee and still more rarely will
you find him the first to terminate a
conversation. He is as tenacious in conversational
competition as he is lax
in business aggression. In fact, he
would far rather stand on the corner<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
and describe to you, in detail, the
amount of work that has been shouldered
upon him by So and So and So
and So’s wife, than to make the slightest
attempt to accomplish any of the sundry
duties imposed. And yet he knows,
and so do you, if you are at all versed
in Cape ways, that he will receive ample
financial return for his slightest
service.</p>

<p>There is no such word as hurry in
the bright lexicon of Cape Cod, but I
confess it with some trepidation, for
my many Cape friends will take violent
exception to my statement, true as it
is. And yet I do not blame them. I
believe it is thoroughly accounted for
by the climate; for when I first visit<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
the Cape in the spring or early summer,
I always experience a languor
which makes the slightest effort seem
a task of large proportions. In short, I
am lazy and prefer to see some one
else do it. This feeling generally passes
away with the sheer joy of vacation
days, days of freedom and fresh air;
but I realize that the climate breeds a
lack of ambition, to which I doubtless
would succumb were I to live on
without interruption amid the Cape-Codders.</p>

<p>And therefore I prefer to think of
the Cape as a playground for the initiate,
a wonderland for children, and
a haven of rest for the tired of all ages,
a land where lines and wrinkles quickly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
disappear under the soothing softness
of the tempered climate.</p>

<p>Joseph Lincoln has told us of the
people; Thoreau has written of the
place; but no one will really know
the Cape unless he becomes a part of it.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE CASUAL DWELLING-PLACE</span></h2>

</div>

<p>Is there a reader who has not at one
time or another gloated over the terrors,
the thrills, and the mysteries
which, in fiction, invariably lie hidden
in an unoccupied house? When one
stops to think of it nearly all the literature
of roguery, as so clearly set
forth in former days by Wilkie Collins,
Gaboriau, down to Conan Doyle<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
and Mary Roberts Rinehart, possesses
as its most important stage-setting an
untenanted mansion. It may be one of
those familiar villas generally located
somewhere near Hampstead Heath, a
house set apart from its neighbors
and surrounded by a hedge; a house
with every appearance of having
been closed for several years and
now showing the first signs of decay;
or it may be one of those somber
brownstone houses situated in one of
the many New York residential streets,
where every house so closely resembles
its fellows as to court mischief to
all who may return late at night; or
again, it may be one of those palatial
country houses set among lawns and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
gardens which are invariably described
with broad, magnificent porticoes toward
which spotless limousines are
continually approaching at top speed
for no apparent reason. Such a setting
is perhaps the commonest, and the
time is always just before the family
arrive for the season or just after they
have left for other equally expensive
quarters. Now and then the novelist
will modestly cast the fate of his
story in the seclusion of a deserted
cottage by the sea or a lonely hut
among the hills, but rarely does this
occur nowadays. The mystery story
is as dependent upon luxury of setting
as is the modern bachelor upon his creature
comforts. And, therefore, if the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
devotee of fiction chose to apply himself
to this theme, he would find that
nearly all novelists, great and small,
from Dickens to Oppenheim, from
Hawthorne to Anna Katharine Green,
have utilized the empty house to bring
about the climactic point in the weaving
of some gruesome tale. So clear
are these fictional features that, by the
association of ideas, one’s fears and
apprehensions are invariably aroused
whenever the occasion arises when
an unoccupied house or even an untenanted
apartment must be entered.</p>

<p>With that unmistakable odor of
mustiness comes afresh this uncomfortable
sense of trepidation (hardly
fear, perhaps), and with it a conviction<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
that rats and mice are hidden
spectators, and that the darkness and
gloom could well hide crime as well
as the thieves themselves. This entire
mental state is largely caused by the
aforesaid novelists, who I doubt not
would have the same hesitancy in
opening the door of a darkened chamber
or in groping down the cellar
stairs of a house long left to disintegration.</p>

<p>In short, reading has trained us all
to regard empty houses with suspicion,
an absurd state of mind which should
be quickly dispelled, for in the case of
nine out of every ten, yes, or ninety-nine
out of every hundred houses, there
is no cause whatever for suspicion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span></p>

<p>There is a sunny little house on the
shores of Buzzard’s Bay which remains
unoccupied except for ten weeks in the
summer. Its shutters are closed and
fastened long before the oaks have
turned to their gorgeous fall colorings
or the marigolds and phlox have lost
the freshness of their bloom.</p>

<p>The soft, salty breeze, rippling the
waters, the dancing rays of the September
sun through the swaying pines,
give a joyous setting to this cottage
by the water, courting as it were an
occupant. The hardiest of that overworked
class of readers who rely upon
mystery stories would find it difficult
to conjure up a tragedy for such a spot.
The native Cape-Codders, knowing the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
owners, always glance over toward
the cottage as they pass by in the hope
of finding a blind open or a light
through the trees, to show that some
of “ther fam’ly be down for Sunday.”
For this is one of the important services
which this particular cottage renders
to its owners. As the scion of
the family (aged ten) once sagely remarked,
“We use the cottage more
when it’s closed than when it’s open.”
And to each and every member of
this house its welcome is always the
same. The family reach the house
after dark on a Saturday night. The
lock readily responds to familiar fingers,
the door creaks a friendly welcome
as the family grope their way<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
through the hall in good-humored rivalry
to see which shall be the first to
secure the box of matches always kept
on the right-hand corner of the mantelpiece
in the living-room for this
emergency. Then, as the lamps are
lighted, the old familiar objects appear
precisely as they had been left, perhaps
six months before, with a coating
of dust, to be sure, but nothing which
a few moments and a dustcloth could
not remove; for dust in this region is
little known. True, the chairs, or at
least such of them as possess cushions,
are shrouded in covers. The sofa is a
bulging conglomeration of cushions,
gathered from all hammocks and piazza
furniture; but a few deft passes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
by the fairy godmother of this establishment,
and presto, the cushions are
distributed and the sofa offers a cozy
retreat for the entire party. Otherwise
the living-room is livable. A fire ready
laid is only waiting for a match and a
turn of the hand to open the flue.
Such is a cottage by the sea if it has
been planned and built as it should be,
not alone for summer use, but also for
spring and autumn holidays.</p>

<p>The little cottage in question is a
very ancient affair. A long line of
sturdy Cape-Codders dwelt in it, uncomfortably,
for generations. It was
not until a few years ago that it
was entirely renovated, enlarged, and
equipped for summer use. Much care<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
and thought were given to its convenience,
and it stands to-day as a
model for perennial use as a casual
habitation. But it has certain drawbacks;
as, for instance, plaster. Such
a cottage, to secure the maximum
comfort with the minimum of expense,
should be unplastered, and
without a cellar so that the circulation
of air will keep the house free
from dampness. There should be a
kerosene cooking-stove in the kitchen
so that the cooking can be done without
jeopardizing the water coil or
boiler. Furthermore, unless one’s family
and friends are experts in the culinary
art, the usual stove fire is built
regardless of the cost of coal or kindlings,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
and the fire itself is apt to take
a good deal of time in the making,
several trials often being necessary
before the coals kindle into a respectable
glow. The problem of water is
perhaps the most troublesome. No
house, of course, can be left with the
water on during the winter season.
These Cape cottages are no exception
to the rule, and every pipe is
carefully drained and the faucets
greased to prevent rust.</p>

<p>To go to the trouble of turning on
the water system for an occasional
Sunday or holiday was manifestly out
of the question, and so the owner
of this particular cottage solved the
difficulty in true backwoods fashion.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
A small stone tank, placed in the
closet behind the stove, holding not
over five gallons of water, was always
religiously filled. This served as lubricant
for a hand pump at the kitchen
sink. One of the first duties in starting
in housekeeping was to heat a
pail of this water, thaw out the pump,
and thus secure the supply which adequately
filled the family needs for the
day or two of camp life to be enjoyed.</p>

<p>You will ask what of bedding and
blankets? They are there at hand.
As a matter of fact, the less one puts
away the better for each and every
article. All blankets hung upon ropes
stretched across the attic are dry and
ready for use. Upon such occasions as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
the one noted, the family do without
sheets and sleep fully as soundly. The
blazing of the fire logs and the warmth
of the living-room have given to all
a drowsy feeling which defies wakefulness
when once the head touches
the pillow.</p>

<p>If any one should contemplate making
use of his summer house in this
fashion, there are certain suggestions
which it would be well to follow;
points which any yachtsman or camper
would never overlook.</p>

<p>First of all, there should be a place
for everything and everything should
be in place. You can never tell when
you will return. Perhaps you may be
delayed and not arrive until after dark,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
chilled and hungry from a long motor
ride. At such times a fire ready laid,
with a good store of dried wood, is
essential to happiness and comfort.</p>

<p>There should always be a list of
provisions left at the house so that
you may avoid duplication in purchasing
supplies. Besides food, there should
also be such necessaries as soap,
matches, and candles. These should
always be left in the boxes to prevent
the mice and squirrels from robbing
one. A good scheme is to build a
zinc-lined cupboard in the pantry in
which to keep such perishables.</p>

<p>Kerosene is dangerous to leave about,
and it is well to bring this with you
for the cook-stove; furthermore, it is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
hard to remember whether enough
has been left at the house for twenty-four
hours’ use.</p>

<p>Care should always be taken to leave
the small water tank filled unless you
plan to secure your supply from a friend
or neighbor.</p>

<p>Your pots and pans, cutlery, dishes,
and glasses should always be washed
and put away in order before leaving,
ready for instant use.</p>

<p>A little system will make all the difference
in the world in the comfort and
enjoyment of such an outing, and will
save labor, so that your actual work will
be done in much less time and the daylight
hours can be given over to the
outdoor life which endears the place<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
to each and every member of your
family.</p>

<p>Whether it be a canoe, a knockabout,
a gun, or a fishing-line, the life
outside the cottage will be a reflection
of that within and your enjoyment will
come from the facility with which you
manage the essentials of simple living.
And so after you have enjoyed your
day in the open, you will return to the
cottage and discover that the simple
comforts which it offers, while perhaps
lacking the luxury of your daily routine
at home, will be enjoyed with a
relish far beyond that existence in a
brick block, amid a mass of bric-à-brac
and surrounded by servants. In
its place you will devour an unusual<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
amount of food which tastes the better
because you have cooked it, and later
you will fall asleep with the wind singing
in the trees, and the waves lapping
the shores. The occasional barking of
a dog will arouse no apprehension,
and the dread of haunted houses, of
mysterious deeds accomplished behind
closed shutters, will have vanished
until you are safe home again with a
“thriller” to pass away the time before
it is seasonable to retire.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE UBIQUITOUS CLAM</span></h2>

<p>“They scattered up &amp; down ... by yᵉ waterside,
wher they could find ground nuts and clams.”
(William Bradford, <i>History of Plymouth Plantation</i>,
<span class="allsmcap">II</span>, 130.)</p>

</div>

<p>Surprising as it may seem, the clam,
at least under his own name, does not
appear in the Encyclopædia Britannica.
And yet the clam is proverbial, metaphorical,
and substantial, so substantial,
in fact, that individuals of uncertain<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
digestion have been rendered distinctly
unhappy after a hearty encounter.
But what is more surprising to
the average person, and especially to
the novice in clamming, is where all
the clams come from for the unending
clam-bakes, clam-chowders, and the
various concoctions necessitating a generous
supply of these silent shellfish.
A journey to the beach at low tide
(for all clammers know from the reference
to that animal’s joyous spirit at
high water that clamming is useless at
that period) generally fails to accomplish
more than a very lame back,
muddy feet, and a paltry dozen or
more specimens of the clam family,
generally of immature age. The profusion<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
of empty shells scattered about
encourage the clammer into the belief
that here, at least, is a favorable locality
for his first efforts, and he grasps
his fork and bends low, thrusting the
implement into the black ooze with
keen anticipation that the mud will disclose
a whole family of clams, ready
at hand for capture; but, instead, he is
rewarded by finding a number of white
shells, seemingly clams, but in reality
merely their shells held closely together
by mud and sand, the skeletons
of former bivalves whose souls have fled
to other worlds and whose bodies have
long since disappeared the way of all
flesh. And so he seeks another spot, and
the same process is repeated. Each time<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
he is conscious of an increasing stiffening
of the back, recalling former
twinges of lumbago, and after an hour
or so the tide forces him to retreat, and
he returns dejectedly to partake of a
thin clam-broth, upon the top of which,
as a consolation prize, his wife has
tactfully placed a little whipped cream.</p>

<p>And yet the clam is ubiquitous, once
you know him, and the clammer, himself,
has been immortalized by Mr.
William J. Hopkins in several delightful
stories with which certain readers
are familiar. The enthusiast soon learns
their favorite haunts and on favorable
tides he gathers these bivalves by the
pailful. For chowders and for bait alike
he digs, constructs a wire cage in which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
to keep his precious clams from day
to day, and week to week, and thus
they become, as it were, almost a part
of his summer <i>entourage</i>.</p>

<p>The clam is a numerous family
(<i>Mya arenaria</i>, were one to become
scientific). The ordinary mud clam
which inhabits the tidewater harbors of
our coasts; the quahog, whose young,
termed “little necks,” are served, uncooked,
as appetizers; and the sea
clam, are very familiar in appearance
and habits; but all varieties are secured
in different ways and in varying localities,
and therein lies an added charm
to the pastime of clam-digging.</p>

<p>There is a certain portion of the
coast line in a very attractive section<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
of Cape Cod, which shall be nameless,
where all varieties of these mollusks
abound, and it is difficult at times to
decide which variety to pursue. The
ordinary mud clam is generally sought
on the especially low tides so kindly
afforded by the moon at stated intervals.
It is then that the tide line resembles
miniature trenches—first-line
defenses, if you will—so many and
so persistent are the pursuers, who
look for all the world as if they were
digging themselves in in anticipation
of a machine-gun attack.</p>

<p>The quahog is more secure, for he
lives in No Man’s Land, beyond the
trenches and just under the surface of
the mud. If one is walking up a salty,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
muddy creek—and surprising as the
fact may seem, one often does follow
this watery by-path—the foot will
continue to disclose these big fellows.
In the course of an hour of this method
of locomotion, a full pail of quahogs
may be secured without further discomfort
than a pair of wet legs and
two very muddy feet. The fishermen,
however, regard such efforts as time
lost. They manipulate two long-handled
rakes bound together at the bottom,
and with this implement a sort
of hand-dredging process is performed
which apparently yields better results.
But it is only the native fisherman,
with his knowledge of tides and currents,
of sandy or muddy bottoms, of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
channels and shoals, who can successfully
locate the choice spots where
these quahogs lie hidden beneath
water, seaweed, and mud.</p>

<p>The sea clam is as immaculately
clean as his harbor cousin is muddy.
He is likewise found just beneath the
surface of the water, buried in firm
white sand over which the white-crested
breakers foam on the beach.
These clams are not greatly valued
as food. They are gamy and tough
in comparison to their brethren and
a sharp contrast in appearance, with
their delicate, smooth shell of an exquisite
<i>café au lait</i> color, and it is for
this reason, perhaps, that only the
most enthusiastic of clammers or fishermen<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
after bait know of their whereabouts.</p>

<p>Along the beaches where thousands
of Americans may be seen in impressionistic
attire, disporting themselves
by bobbing up and down in the waves,
one could easily secure a pailful of
these fascinating creatures by wading
out and groping in the sands. No more
exhilarating pleasure can be secured
from surf bathing than in this pastime,
which calls for agility in dodging the
breakers as they roll in. While you
are in the act of dislodging a fine fat
specimen, your pail grasped in one
hand, the other embedded in the sand
seeking your prey, your body is swept
first in, then out, by the waves. In<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
order to regain your balance you lose
your hold, just escape being toppled
over by the next wave rushing toward
its finish on the sands, and miss the
clam; and so the process begins all
over again.</p>

<p>The “little necks” have their own
places of abode close to the surface
of the mud in sequestered inlets. Now
and again the plebeian clammer will
come across a stray family of little
fellows while in quest of the common
variety, but as a pastime digging for
“little necks” has but little zest.</p>

<p>And now, after realizing the fascination
of clamming, why be surprised
if, when you run down to the
Cape for a week-end, your host grips<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
you with a hand, cold and moist from
submersion—a “clammy hand”; and
why be surprised if on the following
day, instead of the routine of golf and
tennis, you are initiated into this simple
sport? The surprise would come
to the writer of this slight dissertation
if he should find you callous to the
delight of clamming or disrespectful
of the occupation of the clammer.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="IV">IV<br />
<span class="smaller">A BY-PRODUCT OF CONSERVATION</span></h2>

</div>

<p>The torrent of conservation surged
over our community in war-time with
a mighty roar, carrying with it all
thought of flowers and lawns, and
making chaos of our cherished plans
for a summer garden. With a velocity
which only social enterprise could initiate,
New England became a market
garden from Eastport to Greenwich.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
Conservation developed back yards and
vacant lots into gardens, and bank
clerks into farmers, enthusiastic at the
prospect, and innocent of the coming
torments which weeds and pests would
soon bring with them. And so, for
this same reason, our flower garden
on the Cape simmered down to a few
nasturtiums and whatever blossoms
of a perennial nature cared to show
themselves, while our spring borders,
usually a riot of color, were given
over to vegetables.</p>

<p>What, then, should we have in our
vases to reflect the profusion of the
outdoor season? For a room without
flowers in summer is as devoid of
character and charm as a man without<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
a necktie. The solution, naturally,
was soon found by many in the wild
flowers, and if conservation has accomplished
nothing else, its gift to us
of an appreciation of the beauty and
variety of these exquisite plants will
more than repay our efforts to grow
potatoes, beans, and corn at exorbitant
prices with doubtful success.</p>

<p>The last days of school for the children
and certain affairs at the office,
together with fixed habits which tyrannize
over the household, kept us
from leaving for the Cape until late
in June, so that we missed the mayflowers
which have made Cape Cod
famous for generations. The iris and
violets, too, had disappeared, as well<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
as the dogwood with its delicate and
generous pink-and-white petals. A few
short hours after our arrival, my little
daughter discovered near by some exquisite
specimens of the wild lupine
growing just as I had last seen it upon
the slopes of Mount Tamalpais near
San Francisco, although perhaps not
in the same profusion.</p>

<p>From that first day until well into
September, our living-room was made
joyous by a succession of flowers as
delicate and graceful as ever came
from the highly cultivated gardens of
the idle rich—a term which will soon
vanish and justly so.</p>

<p>The wild roses were late and never
more plentiful or more perfect. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
daisies, arranged amid clusters of shiny
bayberry and huckleberry leaves, were
transformed into stately decorations.
The broom, as it is often called, which
abounds in certain sections of the Cape,
planted there in past years without
doubt, gave one a sense of having been
ferried across the sea overnight, while
our own columbine and wild geranium
made a pleasing variety, especially
when arranged with the soft green of
the wild sarsaparilla.</p>

<p>With the coming of July, the <i>Hudsonia</i>,
or beach heather, clothed our
foreground with brilliant yellow spots,
touches of the sun here and there,
while the low wild shrubs and grasses
seemed to grow overnight in their desire<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
to hide our view of the water.
After a week of rain in which we were
confined to the flowers about the house—succulent
clover, Queen Anne’s
lace, and a wide variety of tall grasses,
which, mingled with pine branches,
form admirable wall decoration—our
desire for botanical information led us
to scour the near-by country, not with
guide-book, motor-maps, or even a
copy of “How to Know the Wild
Flowers,” but to journey simply forth,
either on foot or tucked tightly into
our Ford car. To come unexpectedly
upon one of the many ponds dotted
with lilies and fringed with a variety
of flowering shrubs caused as delightful
a sensation as the same sight a few<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
years ago would have aroused, only
then it would have stimulated a very
different desire—the thought of a
possible bass, lazily drifting below the
surface, to be tempted, perhaps, by a
fly, would have been uppermost. But
this summer our sport lay in securing
wild flowers, a harmless and charming
pastime in which for the first time all
the members of the family found equal
enjoyment, and even our near neighbors,
confirmed golfers, admitted the
fascination of our newly acquired sport.
To return laden with lilies, wild clematis,
marsh mallows, delicately pink
upon their tall, stately stems, cat-tails,
red lilies, the fragrant clethra, and a
variety of other flowers whose names<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
are to be discovered in the winter over
a “complete botanical guide,” savored
of a veritable triumph.</p>

<p>Our growing interest in this wild
garden was amply rewarded, for now
in August the flowers were at their
height and it became doubly interesting.
Whether the discovery of new
varieties or the satisfaction of gathering
and arranging the commonest
weeds brought the greater pleasure,
it is hard to judge. The recollection
of a tall, graceful copper vase filled
with the despised chicory and bouncing
Bet, the blue of the one and the delicate,
pinkish purple of the other blending
charmingly and supported in contrast
by a few sprays of sumac leaves,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
lingers as one of the floral discoveries
of the summer. A mass of fireweed,
interspersed with slender sprays
of salt grass in full bloom, is another.</p>

<p>And yet to the sportsman or the
embryonic scientist, individuals of very
similar characteristics, an excursion
into the back country through the
woods, a good, long, honest tramp in
pursuit of new floral game, and the
finding, now a clump of cardinal-flowers
and again the deadly nightshade
(for the sportsman and scientist
alike are fearless), is keen pleasure.</p>

<p>At times we would return with little
booty to show for our trouble, a
gathering of St. John’s-wort, perhaps,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
or a few stalks of mallow or one-eyed
daisies, but never empty-handed and
always with the exhilaration of the
thought that here was a garden without
limit, without weeds, and without
the cares and expenses to which we
were accustomed.</p>

<p>In arrangement, it must be confessed
that discussion often arose. Certain
members of the family, who shall be
nameless, preferred a few blooms alone
in each vase, while others clamored
loudly for garnishings of salt grasses
and other green decorations. Upon such
flowers as butterfly-weed and tansy,
such discussions nearly ended in riots,
and only a tactful distribution of these
blooms to those who had gathered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
them with full authority as to arrangement
secured peace.</p>

<p>The goldenrod made its appearance
earlier than usual, the handsome, sturdy
variety which grows close to the tidewater
being especially fine. With it
came the purple and white wild asters,
which are in reality so much more beautiful
than the cultivated kind, and the
sea lavender vying with baby’s-breath
in its delicacy.</p>

<p>In this September a pleasant surprise
came in the discovery of a flower
which we called—and possibly incorrectly
so—the wild primrose, growing
close to the coast among the pines and
scrub oaks; and blooming at this same
time was the beach pea, a long, climbing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
vine of a pinkish-violet color, luxuriating
amid the desolation of the
sand-dunes.</p>

<p>Close upon the heels of these blossoms,
which both seemed to belong to
the springtime, the turning of the
leaves, the crispness of the air, the
short evenings, and the aforesaid three
governing reasons, school, office, and
domestic domination, decided us with
more reluctance than ever to close
the cottage. It was not until our luggage
was packed and ready that our
final gatherings of the season’s wild
flowers were removed and the vases
put away against the coming of next
spring.</p>

<p>It still remains to be seen whether<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
conservation will ultimately lead to a
saving in the cost of food (for Americans
are more given to preaching than
to practice) but it has served us well
in our appreciation of certain of the
good things in life.</p>

<span class="smaller">MOTOR TYRANNICUS</span></h2>

</div>

<p>In the dim days of a decade ago—a
generation might well have passed, for
time is measured by the march of events
rather than the procession of years—I
remember yearning for the possession
of an automobile. It mattered not what
make, or shape or size or year. I was
oblivious to the merits of six cylinders
as opposed to four. I laughed at the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
enthusiast who reckoned upon the
length of wheel-base as deciding his
comfort or the question of demountable
rims as governing his decision as to
which make to select. All I coveted
was something on wheels (preferably
four) of my own which might go or
even might not go, for so rampant
was the possessive desire in my heart
that the chief thing in the world seemed
to me at that time to be able to say “My
motor” in an utterly casual, matter-of-fact
tone, and back it up by nodding
my head in the direction of the barn,
which after the fashion of marriages
had suddenly changed its name overnight
by the possession of a master, and
so became my “garage.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span></p>

<p>This ridiculous state of mind is easy
to account for. In winter we lived in
the suburbs where it seemed to both
my wife and to me that every friend
we had owned a car. In summer we
sojourned upon Cape Cod, where the
motor had replaced the runabout so
completely that our old horse looked
like a prehistoric relic of the Stone
Age. Added to this was the ignominy
of knowing that the Butcher and Baker
both possessed machines and had that
mythological person the Candlestick-maker
abided in our town, doubtless
he also would have honk-honked his
way by our door.</p>

<p>In short, the thing got so badly on
our nerves that finally, with full knowledge<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
of the financial iniquity involved,
I purchased one of those hopelessly
plebeian affairs which travel under so
many opprobrious pseudonyms—a
Ford. From that day to this I have
owned some sort of a car and have
thought myself a wise and a fortunate
man, and subconsciously I have felt
myself rather more of a person because
of this possession, for such is the frailty
of human nature.</p>

<p>To-day, however, marks a turning-point,
a milestone, a crisis in my career.
Personally I consider this day
one of triumph—I have sold my car.
I have no independent means of transportation
other than my own good
legs—or, at least, they were so until<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
I neglected them—and I rejoice in
my motorless state. I feel a sense
of exhilaration in my freedom from
Fords, from the bondage of Buicks,
from captivity in my Chandler Sedan.
Such exhilaration is doubtless hard to
understand because precisely the same
conditions now exist which originally
drove me into buying that first “Universal
Car,” only in a more exaggerated
degree. My children (and now
there are more of them) are always
clamoring for rides, even for the short
distance of a few blocks which separates
our house from school. My wife
(and I must confess there is now
more of her too) still plies her trade
of exchanging visits and buzzing about<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
town all day long, never thinking of
walking, and for myself, I have become
mutely accustomed to the rôle
of family chauffeur when not attempting
that increasing impossibility, the
attempt to make both ends meet.</p>

<p>And yet, is it after all so hard to
understand this relief? In the first
place, the car, no matter what variety,
either goes or it does not go. If by
chance it goes, you must go with it.
If it does not go, you must make it
go or get some one who knows more
about it than you do, and who costs
more than you do, to mend it. That
means that you go upstairs into your
own room and change into old clothes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
reserved for this purpose, go down
again and out to the garage, where
you stand in contemplative mood for
some moments before crawling under
the machine. When you are safely
landed in a dripping pool of oil, your
children and your neighbor’s children
come trooping in from play and ask
you why you are there and what you
are doing. This in itself is disconcerting,
for you generally don’t know.
Having successfully found that out
you slowly emerge from your cramped
quarters, which compare only with an
upper berth, return to your room, resume
the garb of a successful business
man, and take the car to a garage and
there wait until some one makes it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
<i>sound</i> all right. This individual vies
with the tax collector in separating
you from all excess cash.</p>

<p>This does not happen every day, I
admit, but there is a sensation in the
back of the mind of nearly every motorist
which is more or less constant.
You know that you worry when the
car does not go. There is no ground
for speculation upon this point. You
worry about what the matter is, and
when you find you can’t mend it, and
take it to a garage to be repaired, you
worry as to whether you have taken
it to the right garage, or the right
man in the garage. You fuss over
the cost and you continually wonder
whether the repairs have been properly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
done or whether the blamed thing
won’t break out in the same place the
next time you take the car out. And
during this whole period you feel in
the bottom of your heart that you could
have mended it just as well yourself.</p>

<p>Then there are the worries when
it <i>does</i> go. You wonder when the tires
are going to give out, whether they
are too flat or too inflated, whether
you put in gas before you started, and
how the water is. You are continually
guessing whether you have
too much or too little oil, and you
generally guess wrong.</p>

<p>These, however, are all mere trifles,
the superficial maunderings of a sensitive
organism. Your major worries<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
may be classified under three headings:</p>

<p>First: the worry of changing cars.
Every year the question comes up for
family discussion, competing valiantly
with the problem of when we are to move
to the Cape. Shall we turn in the old car
and get a new one? If so, what kind?—and
then follows a month of violent
discussion in which my wife and the
children take one side and I the other.
By instinct I am a modest man and
by habit cautious. I do not like changes,
especially sudden changes, and so my
inclination is either to stick to the old
car for another year or buy a new one
like it. My family—why I cannot
say—seem to be oppositely inclined.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
My wife avers that So-and-So has had
great luck with a ⸺. Billy, my eldest,
backs her up with several lengthy
anecdotes told him by So-and-So’s son,
proving the excellence of that make
above all others. I am sufficiently
shaken in my opinion to consult with
the garage-man from whom I bought
my car, only to be shown a car of the
variety mentioned in deplorable condition
awaiting the mechanic’s skill.
Poor engine, inadequate something or
other,—I can’t remember the name,—and
so it goes. My office is thronged
with automobile salesmen so that work
is impossible, while the evenings are
passed in futile argument until the
final verdict is given, resulting generally<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
in a compromise—a new car is
purchased of a trifle better type at a
considerable advance in price and the
old car sacrificed for a song. Those
days of budding greenness for which
we have longed through all the cold,
useless days of winter are utterly ruined
by this fearful problem.</p>

<p>The second worry comes with
breakfast daily. Who is to use the car
during the day? The day being balmy,
I had thought of going to town in it,
especially as I wanted to make a call
on the way home. My wife, it seems,
had planned to go to the dressmaker.
I should have guessed it. Billy, who
has just arrived at the legal age which
foolishly permits youth to endanger<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
the lives and liberty of American citizens,
had planned to take a number
of his cronies to St. Mark’s School to
see a ball game. Billy, as can be readily
imagined, wins out.</p>

<p>This daily observance takes the entire
breakfast period and often leads to
slight feeling. I say slight because I
rarely ever secure the car myself unless
it needs repairing.</p>

<p>The last worry may perhaps be
more likened to fear. “What next?” I
generally remark—for this third
division concerns our friends. In that
happy decade, now but a dream, we
used to live in a delightful community,
surrounded by friends who dropped
in and then dropped out again, both<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
happy incidents in our daily life. But
now, who has time to see his neighbors
when every one is frantically
motoring to some distant acquaintance
miles away? What can you do
when some friend at the end of nowhere
invites you to dinner because
she knows you have a motor? You
go because your wife explains that this
sort of thing is what a motor is for.</p>

<p>Is this not a matter for worry?—to
work in an office until five; to journey
home with the knowledge that in
exactly thirty minutes you start out, in
a car which needs oiling and when
one of the tires should have more air,
for a distant suburb, where you are to
meet a number of people you do not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
know and never care to see again.
That this sort of thing is going to increase
just as long as you have a
pesky car is more than a cause for
worry. It is a calamity.</p>

<p>In a trice all this vanished, for I sold
my car. I remember hearing the story
of a Southerner whose property was
taken from him during the Civil War
and who later was robbed of all the
money on his person. He confessed
to a feeling of intense joy and relief,
for with his loss of property went his
feeling of responsibility, and care-free
he entered the army and fought a gallant
fight.</p>

<p>And so upon that day I walked with
elastic tread, head up, chest out, delighting<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
in the discovery of freedom.
I care not that my friends all possess
cars. I’ve had one—several in fact—and
I can afford to buy others, but
I am not going to. That is, not yet
(and here I remember my family,
somewhat dubiously). I plan to renew
the pleasures of daily rambles over the
beautiful hills of my own town. I plan
to renew old friendships with my neighbors
near by. I look forward to an
occasional Sunday at home. In short,
I picture the joy of being without
a motor.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, however, this
vision was short-lived. In the first
place, the ramble over the old familiar
hills made me so beastly lame that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
my Sunday at home was a painful
one, and the day was punctuated by
the complaints of each and every member
of the family over the loss of the
car. I ventured out, still painfully, to
call upon one or two of my old neighbors,
just for a run in and out again,
but they, it seemed, were out in their
motors, and so I returned dejectedly
to the sad-faced group in my own
living-room, where we managed to
exist until bedtime, conversing upon
our prospective move to the Cape,
and what it meant to the various members
of the family to be—as my
daughter puts it—a million miles away
from every one with no means of ever
leaving the house. And so it was the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
Cape and its appeal which broke my
defenses, for I must confess our seasonal
trips there were a delightful part
of our existence, to say nothing of the
joys of our summer life.</p>

<p>The next day I took an early train
to town, and I came home that evening
somewhat sheepish, but reasonably
happy, for I came in a new car,
which bids fair to be the best one yet;
it is certainly the most expensive.</p>

<span class="smaller">“CHANGE AND REST”—SUMMER BARGAINING</span></h2>

</div>

<p>Although on the surface Cape Cod
seems to offer a haven of refuge to
that much overworked appendage to
the modern man, the pocket-book,
there are dotted here and there upon
the highways and byways many comparatively
innocent pitfalls.</p>

<p>To a close student of these danger<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
spots, they may be grouped under
the heading “Tea-Rooms, Arts and
Crafts Stores, and Antique Shops.”</p>

<p>I know of no greater relief than to
escape from town and come to the
Cape. Once there, the daily routine of
office, the absence of any assigned
duty, the leisure hours passed in or
on the water or idly knocking about
the golf links, tend to merge one day
into another, so that time flashes past
at an alarming rate. But every now
and again comes a day when some
member of the family suggests that
we take the motor and extend our
vision. It is upon such occasions that
we test the financial astuteness of the
aborigines.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span></p>

<p>One never visits the Cape without
discovering how effectively the climate
stimulates the appetite. What wonder,
therefore, that every village and
hamlet possesses a Tea-Room of varying
attraction?</p>

<p>The stop is made and the Tea-Room
visited, only to find that the family, in
addition to ordering the tea, with its
accompaniment of toast and cake, or,
for the younger members, a bottle
of ginger ale or an ice-cream cone,
are bent upon securing a souvenir.
The Tea-Room is generally furnished
with an assortment of articles intended
for just such gullibles as ourselves.
There are, for instance, baskets of assorted
sizes and colors, for flowers, or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
fruit, or sewing, or pine cones; in fact
for everything that should be thrown
away, but isn’t. We have several
such baskets at home, but that does
not prevent some member of the family
from buying another. It will do
for a Christmas present. Then there
are varieties of other things made far
away and designed to lure the cheerful
motorist, such as charmingly decorated
match-cases for elderly people,
noisily painted tin pails for the
children, dainty knockers, and all manner
of knick-knacks for the women
of the party. The invariable assortment
of what, to a man, seems the essence
of uselessness, and yet, I confess
it, attractive to an insidious extent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span></p>

<p>The pocket-book is touched, not
severely, to be sure, but there is a perceptible
shrinkage as we file out to continue
on our harmless junket.</p>

<p>For a few miles we bowl along over
a delightfully smooth road and give
ourselves over entirely to the view. Now
a long stretch of pine woods gives just
a glimpse of the water glistening
through the trees; here and there a
little farmhouse, snugly tucked among
a clump of lilacs close to the road, with
visions of larger establishments in the
distance, out toward the sea, the homes
of summer residents boldly exposed
to the refreshing southwest wind; then
a long stretch of marsh and dune brilliant
in the sun. Suddenly we come<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
upon a more thickly populated district
where many of the old houses have
been purchased and renovated to fit
the needs of city people, who, with the
assistance of some modern architect,
oftentimes make enticing homes of
these structures by the simple addition
of porches and piazzas, with bright
touches of paint here and there on blinds
and doors, and the whole garnished
well with bright flowers, climbing
roses, and cozy hedges.</p>

<p>It is generally near such a settlement
that we come upon the Arts and
Crafts in all their glory.</p>

<p>Compared to the Tea-Room, the
Art-Shop is a veritable mine of treasure.
From a variety of toys which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
would do credit to Schwartz to a complete
set of hand-painted furniture such
as one might expect to find in the window
of the largest furniture store in
Boston during the months of May and
June, seems a far cry for a small shop
occupying a converted bungalow in a
modest Cape town; but this sort of
thing exists, and between these items
there is an almost endless list of what for
a better term may be called “specialties,”
and even I, who scorn the newness
of furnishings as they are displayed
in town, fall a victim first to an exceptionally
soft-toned rag rug, oval in
shape and comfortable to the tread, and
also to a set of doilies made of a light,
colorful variety of oilcloth with dainty<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
pattern that my wife says will save
washing; and lastly to a pair of bayberry
candles, olive green and a full eighteen
inches high, which it seems to me
will give an admirable touch to our
living-room mantel.</p>

<p>The shrinkage in the pocket-book
is easily discernible; in fact I am led to
say briskly that I think we had better
be getting along home, and so we put
our new treasures into the car and proceed
homewards by a new route more
inland.</p>

<p>It is always interesting to try the
lesser known roads even if they are a
bit rougher. They are little traveled and
for this reason pleasanter in midsummer;
one rarely loses the way, for signs<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
are plentiful, and so we wind about the
higher stretches which form the backbone
of the Cape, along sandy roads
which at times diminish to mere cart-paths,
but at all times are passable.</p>

<p>Emerging from this forest district
on one such excursion, we came quite
suddenly upon the forking of two
roads where a clump of neat-looking
farmhouses, a schoolhouse, and a diminutive
church indicated a real town.
Here my eye was arrested by the
magic sign “Antiques” stuck into the
lawn in front of one of the houses.</p>

<p>While I do not admit the slightest
lure in the sign of a Tea-Room except
when hard-pressed by hunger, and but
scant attraction in the Art-Shop, there<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
is something about the word “antique”
that whets my appetite for exploration,
and especially so when found in a quiet
little hamlet off the beaten path and
probably not familiar to the many hundreds
of tourists whose smoothly running
motors of ample proportions bespeak
well-filled pocket-books. Consequently
I grasped the emergency
brake and came to a sudden stop in
spite of a feeble protest from my
daughter and a heavy sigh from my
wife on the back seat.</p>

<p>Where antiques are concerned, I
take the lead, or, to be more accurate,
I stand alone, and so proceeded to the
back door of the house; for those who
know Cape-Codders well enough realize<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
the inconvenience and delay which
a knock at the front door provokes.</p>

<p>Seeing a middle-aged woman bending
over the stove in the kitchen, I
called a merry “Good-afternoon” by
way of salutation.</p>

<p>“Good-afternoon,” she replied as
an echo might have thrown back my
words.</p>

<p>“I saw your sign ‘antiques’ and
thought perhaps I might have a look
at them,” I continued, nothing daunted.</p>

<p>“Mister Eldridge ain’t to home,
but if you want to go out to the barn
you can see what he’s got,” she replied,
without even turning her head
to see what sort of a second-story man
I might be.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span></p>

<p>Here was luck, however, for I could
look over the stock in trade of this
ambitious couple to my heart’s content,
and I made haste to the barn, which I
found converted into one of the most
amazing junk-shops it has ever been
my pleasure to explore.</p>

<p>Crowded together without rhyme
or reason, and with no thought of display,
were the goods and chattels of
generations of Cape-Codders; tables,
chairs, beds, sofas, ice-chests, a parlor
organ, curtain rods, bits of carpet,
crockery in all stages of dilapidation.
On one of the tables a variety of hardware
was strewn about, on one of the
stiff-backed chairs reposed three old
brass lanterns. A Rogers group on a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
kitchen table was flanked by a White
Mountain ice-cream freezer on one
side and a fine old fire bucket on the
other. A four-poster, of apple-wood,
with fluted posts terminating in pineapple
tops, the wood in an excellent
state of preservation, was the repository
of a half-dozen pictures, three
face-down, while one of the others
disclosed itself as a really good copy
of the engraving of Washington and
his family. But to the casual observer,
there seemed scarcely a piece of furniture
or, in fact, anything which was sufficiently
in repair to survive the journey
to my house; furthermore, the rank
and file of articles were of recent date
and had no charm for the collector.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span></p>

<p>However, the very hopelessness of
the quest whetted my appetite, and
to the utter disgust of my family, I
spent a good half-hour rummaging
about, not only in the main part of the
barn, but also in the stalls, and even
in the hayloft, for the whole building
was bulging with what seemed the
cast-off furnishings of the entire Cape.</p>

<p>The result of my examination was
a really fine ship’s lantern which I
found in the loft; a pair of old pewter
pepper pots, reclining in an old soap
dish, and a couple of straight-back
rush-seated chairs, a trifle rickety, but
with the seats in excellent condition
with the original rush plaiting, which
is unmistakable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span></p>

<p>For fear of mislaying my selection,
I had brought them outside the barn,
and at that moment a lanky, middle-aged
farmer drove up in a buggy and
slowly got out.</p>

<p>“Is this Mr. Eldridge?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Thet’s me,” he replied. “Been
havin’ a look over the department
store? I ain’t got in my elevators, an’
the outing department [here he looked
at my golfing tweeds] ain’t much to
brag about, but I’ve got ’most everything
in thar except the town hearse
an’ I’m savin’ that for my mother-in-law.”</p>

<p>By George! I thought, here’s one
of the real old-timers, nothing taciturn
about him, and I pointed to the modest<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
selection I had made and asked him
what the price was.</p>

<p>“Well, as to price,” he replied,
taking off his hat and meditatively
scratching his head, “that’s the worst
of the business. I never just know
what my things are worth. Them
chairs came from old widow Crocker’s,
over by Forestdale. She’d never sell
’em till she died, an’ then she couldn’t
help herself an’ her son-in-law cleaned
the place out, an’ I got quite a lot of
stuff an’ paid him for the lot. What
d’you say to a couple o’ dollars
apiece?”</p>

<p>I said, “Yes,” as soberly as I could.
I would have given much more.</p>

<p>“As to that lantern, it’s a good ’un<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>
and the glass is all right. I shall have
to get at least four dollars.”</p>

<p>“All right,” said I, cheerfully, for
I had seen a smaller one in Chatham
go for eight just a few days before.
“And how about the pepper pots?”</p>

<p>“Oh, you kin have ’em for—let’s
see—’bout seventy-five apiece.” And
I agreed.</p>

<p>“What do you do with all this
stuff?” I asked, as he helped me to
dispose of my treasures in an already
well-filled car.</p>

<p>“Oh, mostly I sell to the Portugees
that come here farmin’ and cranberryin’.
Now an’ then I get some old
stuff same as you jest picked up, but
generally it’s the newer kind they like<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
the best. I jest set that there sign up
’cause I see every durn fellow ’long
the road what has a toothpick or a
shavin’ mug to sell puts up a sign, an’
so, says I, guess I’ll stick up one too.”</p>

<p>And that is the way I became acquainted
with Silas Eldridge, dealer in
antiques, who has sold me many a real
treasure, but I keep his whereabouts
as secret as possible, for of all the fascinating
places for picking up astonishing
bargains on Cape Cod, his old
dilapidated barn offers the most surprises.</p>

<span class="smaller">A BLUE STREAK</span></h2>

</div>

<p>Slang is both the curse and the delight
of the English language, and that
form of slang which our British friends
term “Americanisms,” and which we
have now largely adopted as our national
mode of communication, is not
confined to the youth of to-day by any
means. In the home, in business, and
of course in sport, slang has found its<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
way and has spread like the weeds in
the garden of the over-enthusiastic
commuter. I remember hearing a
clergyman of national reputation and
advancing years say a short time ago,
after a satisfying excursion of some
sort, that he had “had more fun than
a goat,” and I defied him to elucidate
that time-worn phrase to my satisfaction.</p>

<p>The derivations and origins of American
idioms and colloquial expressions
are vastly interesting, not only in showing
the resourcefulness of our people
in cutting wordy corners and in the
development of a certain form of humor
which I do not defend, but in shedding
real light upon the whys and wherefores<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
of our universe down to its smallest
detail. A temperamental curiosity
has led me from time to time to look
up certain of the commoner expressions,
and I am indebted to this eccentric
hobby for several pleasurable
experiences.</p>

<p>Many years ago—so many in fact
that the memory is distasteful—I
went to a horse-race where the winner
passed our stand at a pace which my
companion described as “going like a
blue streak,” a familiar term with
which I ignorantly agreed at the time.
I suppose that since then I have heard
it repeated many hundred times, but
it was not until last summer when my
son applied it to a motor-boat passing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
out of the harbor, that I thought of
inquiring into its origin, and discovered,
much to my surprise, that it applied
to the illusive and disconcerting
movements of the ordinary sea crab,
often called the “blue claw.”</p>

<p>The discovery piqued my curiosity
and I determined forthwith to investigate
the locomotory accomplishments
of these retiring animals. This was
not as easy a task as I had expected.
The crab is not socially inclined, and
the term “crabbed” is soon apparent.
He is only to be found at low tide,
and generally near the mouth of a
salty creek where the bottom is muddy
and sparsely covered with seaweed
and eelgrass. There in the late summer<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
and fall he can be seen from
canoe or rowboat, if one is patient and
watchful, and the expression to “go
like a blue streak” fits him like a
glove.</p>

<p>Having provided myself with a net
of the butterfly variety, I determined
to secure a specimen, and began my
search among the creeks, so numerous
along the shores of Cape Cod.
Although we came upon quite a number,
it took the entire morning to capture
four.</p>

<p>When unmolested, these creatures
crawl slowly and deliberately about
their business, sluggish in manner and
shabbily dark in appearance, grubbing
about on the bottom, now in, now out<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
of the seaweed, but the instant that
danger is threatened, they undergo
a transformation. The claws, from
sprawling about on the mud at every
angle, are drawn in, and like a flash—or,
far better, “like a blue streak”—the
particular crab that you have
selected for capture darts away at an
angle that leaves you helpless with
wonder at the suddenness of his departure
and at the blueness of his
appearance.</p>

<p>As soon as you have spotted your
prey the excitement begins. Armed
with the net, you crawl quietly to the
bow of the boat and in whispers direct
the rower, now this way, now that,
following the route taken by the capricious<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
crab. Sometimes the water is
deep enough to permit the use of the
oars, at others it is necessary to pole
the boat in and out among the rocks
covered by seaweed, your journey always
attended by silence and stealth as
if the slightest noise would precipitate
in flight this wily crustacean.</p>

<p>At last when you are within striking
distance, the net is plunged in
among the grass and brought up, alas!
empty, and the hunt continues as before.</p>

<p>When, after repeated trials, your
patience is rewarded and a fine big
fellow is caught, the greatest care
must be taken to prevent him from
crawling out of the net and escaping<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>
before he is landed in the boat, for his
activities are ceaseless.</p>

<p>Indeed, even after he is flung deftly
into the pail, his savage struggles may
succeed in freeing him from captivity.
And so it is only with infinite caution
and patience—qualifications necessary
in every game—that you are
able to land your prize, and it is only
then that you will find the explanation
of the color quality of his passing.
As the crab is taken from the water,
its mud-colored shell appears a dark
ultramarine blue, the claws of a
lighter shade, the under part shading
to white tinged with pink; its entire
surface seems metallic in the intensity
of its coloring as it leaves the water.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>
From a slow, lazy animal of peaceful
habits, the crab has become a veritable
monster, savage and fiercely aggressive,
and woe to the unfortunate within
reach of his claws.</p>

<p>His capture is a real experience and
a distinctly sporting event. So interesting
and mysterious is the search,
so active and adventurous the pursuit,
and so exciting and satisfying the actual
catch, that one is tempted to place
crabbing among the big events of a
summer at the seashore.</p>

<p>I know a college professor who annually
devotes the better part of his
vacation to this pastime, and several
of my athletic friends, whose prowess
on the football field was a matter of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
international comment in the papers,
confess to the delights of a crab hunt;
but it is a surprising fact, nevertheless,
that the majority of those who
visit the seacoast each year have never
even heard of the extraordinary fascination
of hunting the originator of
the “blue streak.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="VIII">VIII<br />
<span class="smaller">A FRESH-WATER CAPE</span></h2>

</div>

<p>To the majority of people Cape Cod
spells sea breezes, a tang of salt in the
air, scrub oaks, tall pines, stretches of
sand, and a large appetite. To the
few who know the Cape from more
intimate acquaintance there is added
to this picture a swelling country
densely wooded in sections and spotted
with ponds. It is a source of never-ending<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
wonder how these ponds exist
in a country where the soil is so porous
that a few minutes after a shower
there is no trace of the rain. In almost
every instance they are fed from
springs beneath the surface, and the
solution has been offered and quite
generally believed that much of this
fresh water flows in subterranean
channels having their source far distant
in the White Mountains.</p>

<p>So plentiful is the supply that wells
and pipes, driven a few feet into the
soil at almost any spot, furnish clear,
pure water in ample supply for household
needs. A more remarkable fact
is that at low tide in many of the harbors
and inlets fresh water can be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
found between the high and low
stretches, oozing through the salty
surface of sand and mud. And so the
Cape, for all its salt qualities, has fresh
water in profusion and ponds without
number. In Plymouth County alone
there are 365 ponds, many of them of
substantial size, while the lower Cape
is almost equally well provided.</p>

<p>A generation ago, many of the residents
of Plymouth passed their summers
on the largest of these—Long
Pond. Having the salt breezes most
of the year they wisely sought a change
to inland waters.</p>

<p>Last year I met a gentleman fishing
in Wakeby Pond—made famous
by Cleveland and Joe Jefferson—who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span>
told me he came on from Chicago
every year to pass a month bass fishing.
He was probably ten miles from
the coast, and might have been a hundred
for all the good it did him; but
on the other hand, why not a pond on
the Cape as well as a Rangeley Lake
in Maine? The life is much the same—the
air refreshing and the scenery
delightful.</p>

<p>These larger ponds are fully as
large as many of the Maine lakes.
Long Pond at Plymouth is said to be
ten miles long, and I have seen the
water at Great Herring Pond as rough
as one would care to have it when
canoeing.</p>

<p>To be sure the fishing is not perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span>
so very exciting—few trout,
except in the occasional streams which
have been stocked, but land-locked
salmon, perch, and pickerel to be had
with a little patience, and a shrimp
or so. The real pleasure which these
ponds offer is the surprise and delight
of coming upon them as one
does frequently and quickly while
motoring through the less-frequented
roads. From Plymouth down the Cape
through Sandwich nearly every road
and by-path leads to some picturesque
little sheet of water often closely
wooded to its shores and without a
sign of habitation.</p>

<p>From Wareham or Cotuit, from
Pocasset or Falmouth, from Hyannis<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>
or Chatham—in short, from nearly
every one of the many Cape towns, a
ride of fifteen or twenty minutes will
take one to a pond which might as
well be fifty miles from any center
of human activity. One rarely meets
other adventurers upon such trips, and
the silence and peace which reign
form excellent foils to the summer
life so near at hand.</p>

<p>Those who are wise in Cape ways
possess small canoes mounted upon
two wheels, which are fastened on
behind their cars, so that, when touring
the ponds, they are not limited in
their fishing to the shore or to the
chance of finding a boat.</p>

<p>There are a number of gentlemen<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
who have built small camps upon certain
of these secluded spots for casual
excursions and for spring and fall use.
They are wise. By leaving Boston at
noon they can always be in camp by
sundown ready to enjoy a full Sunday,
while the mighty fisherman who
depends entirely upon the Maine lakes
or the more remote places must plan
a week’s vacation, with the chance of
better sport, to be sure, but no better
life, for the life of a sportsman in the
open is much the same. The great
outdoors is universal in its appeal to
the sane-minded and healthy-bodied.</p>

<p>I have experienced as much heat
and poorer fishing in Nova Scotia
during July as I have on our ponds<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>
of the Cape, and in addition I have
noticed more mosquitoes and midges
to the cubic inch in Canada than on
these same ponds; but of that perhaps
the less said the better.</p>

<p>I have in mind a little excursion which
illustrates these extremes of Cape life,
and it is but one of many. In early
July, when the children, freed from
school restraint, were on the rampage,
and our cottage was bearing the brunt
of an onslaught of youthful visitors,
each of our neighbors having one or two
boys and girls as guests for their children,
life seemed to me an unending
series of activities coupled with ceaseless
slang. In fact, I was “fed up”
with it all, so that when my classmate<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span>
and old friend R⸺ telephoned to say
that he was going up to the pond for
a day or so, I clung to the receiver in
my joy to escape.</p>

<p>The preparations for such a trip are
simple—a blanket, a change of clothing,
a toothbrush, no razor, food enough
to fill a small basket, and—yes, I suppose
it must be confessed—a bottle.</p>

<p>My fishing tackle is always ready.
The bait, however, is more difficult to
secure. With net and pail I hastened to
the creek which enters the harbor near
our cottage, and, it being fortunately
low tide, I was able, in the twenty
minutes left before R⸺’s arrival,
to secure a fair supply of shrimp. That
was all there was to it. We were off<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span>
well within an hour from the time of his
message, and well within another hour
we had arrived at his little shack perched
high above the shore of one of the loveliest
ponds on the Cape, and were settled
for the night.</p>

<p>The camp was well stocked with
wood and simply furnished with camp
beds, the ordinary cooking-utensils,
and such comforts as may be gathered
about a broad hearth and a roaring fire.</p>

<p>Outside, the wind had died down
and not a ripple disturbed the mirrored
surface of the water, which reflected
the delicate outline of cedar, pine, and
oak, a lacy filament which shielded
the setting sun from the already silvered
reflection of the half-moon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span></p>

<p>“A perfect time of a perfect day,
in a well-nigh perfect spot,” I said,
by way of expressing the joy of my
escape.</p>

<p>“Such a burst of eloquence demands
a toast,” remarked my friend.</p>

<p>So we forthwith resorted to the
aforesaid bottle, and then turned to
and prepared supper—the inevitable
scrambled eggs, deviled ham, bread
and marmalade, and coffee.</p>

<p>“To think of that howling mob at
home only twenty minutes away,” I
mused, puffing contentedly at my
pipe and reveling in the silence.</p>

<p>“To think of what a motor will do!”
replied my friend, who was not unaware
of my opinion of cars.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span></p>

<p>I muttered something incoherently,
and squirmed a bit at the thought of
some of my notions.</p>

<p>The next morning we were up with
the sun, and after a hasty bite, put our
canoe into the water and set about our
main task.</p>

<p>We were both fairly familiar with
the haunts of the wily bass. In summer
they lie close to the bottom, the
laziest of fellows, sucking in the bait,
if they notice it at all, in a dreamy fashion,
but, once hooked, they show their
mettle, and so, when I finally felt a
slight strain on my line, I held back
until I was sure of my fish. Yes, I had
him, and a good big one at that.</p>

<p>There is little or no casting in midsummer,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span>
so that I had brought a stouter
trolling-rod, and it was just as well. I
played that fellow for ten minutes,
and when R⸺ finally netted him for
me, we sat and looked at each other
speechless.</p>

<p>“By gad, he’s a five-pounder!”
said my friend excitedly.</p>

<p>“Hum—about four and three
quarters,” I replied in a matter-of-fact
tone to cover my excitement.</p>

<p>We caught twelve that morning,
several weighing two pounds or more,—splendid
fishing, the best we had
ever had on the pond.</p>

<p>When we reached the camp and
weighed my prize, he tipped the scales
at five and three ounces—a record fish.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span></p>

<p>Late in the afternoon the clouds
began to gather and the wind turned
northeast, so we decided to run for
cover.</p>

<p>I was at home in time for dinner,
and found the spell broken. It was
I who did the talking, an amazing
amount of it, while the youngsters sat
open-mouthed when my bass was
brought onto the table in a platter all
to himself, garnished by our cook,
who, so says my wife, is proud of my
ability as a provider.</p>

<p>What more versatile land of summer,
then, can one imagine than the
seashore with an almost permanent
breeze, with a chain of inland ponds
remote and wild in character almost<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>
at one’s back door, motorively speaking?</p>

<p>If variety is truly the spice of life,
what better seasoned offering has any
locality to show than Cape Cod?</p>

</div>

<p>Before you pass judgment upon any
man or woman of your acquaintance,
ask him or her to a picnic. Then if
you are not ready to form a decision,
they will probably have made up their
minds about you. A picnic, so the
Dictionary has it, is an entertainment
in a grove, an ominous and hazardous
place at best for a good time, and one<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span>
to be avoided except by sentimental
couples, and therefore the Dictionary
may be considered narrow-minded in
naming the locality. Furthermore, its
advice is rarely followed in these days,
and the picnics which I prefer, and
they are countless, are held upon the
seashore and, for the most part, in the
sea itself.</p>

<p>There is a white, sandy beach of a
mile or more, banked by great sand-dunes
and bordering a section of Buzzard’s
Bay which is comparatively unknown,
where there are no houses,
not even bath-houses, and where the
delighted squeal of the noisy girl or
the guffaw of the blatant youth is
rarely heard. It is here that we frequently<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>
gather with a few good friends
upon pleasant warm days, for an impromptu
meal <i>al fresco</i>, preceded by
a joyous bath in water as clear as
crystal, warm and yet with a spiciness
that clears the head from all drowsiness
and whets the appetite to a keen
edge.</p>

<p>There are problems to every picnic.
The conventions of life grip hard,
and yet it is curious and sometimes
amusing to see how thin the veneer
really is when the primitive necessities
of a picnic are faced.</p>

<p>The sand-dunes are conveniently
rolling, every now and then dipping
into bowl-like formations, and in these
sequestered or semi-sequestered nooks<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span>
we don our bathing-suits and sally
forth to the sea. One of our friends,
a man somewhat particular as to his
appearance and the soul of modesty,
was directed to the appointed place,
but his love for the view led him up
the slope, so that, innocently turning
our gaze shoreward, the feminine portion
of our gathering was considerably
disconcerted to see the apostle
of Beau Brummel in nature’s garb innocently
viewing the horizon and giving
little heed to his natty bathing-suit,
a black and orange affair with
immaculate white belt which lay at his
feet.</p>

<p>The women, too, those who but a
few moments before would have tried<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span>
in every way to conceal a hole in
their stockings, were glad to borrow
bathing-dresses of any reasonable style
if by chance they had forgotten to
pack their own, and stockings seemed
of no importance.</p>

<p>To line up twenty or more on the
beach and rush for a plunge, to breast
the billows or to grope amid the sands
for sea clams, to race along the beach
for the sheer joy of life, is the glad
part of what I call a picnic. And then
the food! No meal which must be
coaxed along by a cocktail or other
appetizer, to prepare the way for
course after course of indigestible
concoctions planned by fertile-minded
chefs, but honest beef and chicken and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span>
ham sandwiches, delicately prepared
and tastefully arranged. Sandwiches
of lettuce and cheese and paprika;
sandwiches with sardines, with olives;
graham sandwiches with a thin layer
of marmalade or guava intended for
the children, but partaken of by all.
And stuffed eggs, the variety only to
be found at a picnic and eaten in two
gulps, the one place where such table
manners are tolerated.</p>

<p>And it is on picnics that the thermos
bottle is most thoroughly appreciated.
The miracle of hot bouillon,
hot coffee, iced tea, and a variety of
beverages, suitably chilled or heated,
seems ever to be a source of fresh
surprise and pleasure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span></p>

<p>Toward autumn, the picnics offer a
new variety, for the children thrill at
the expectation of cooking their own
dinner. The joys of a bonfire, the excitement
of burying potatoes, corn,
and clams in seaweed, the frying of
ham and eggs, and the occasional treat
of flapjacks when one of our nautical
friends happens to be of our number.
These are but a few of the pleasures
of a picnic such as one encounters on
the shores of Buzzard’s Bay in August
and September.</p>

<p>It must be admitted that there are
certain drawbacks which seem serious
to the individual of fixed habits, tender
feet, and uncertain digestion. There
is, for example, the beautiful white<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span>
sand, glistening in the sun, smooth
as a billiard table and fine as powder.
It must be admitted that after the bath
one is conscious of the pervading quality
of its particles. It is in one’s hair,
one’s shoes, and often elsewhere about
the person. It is discovered invading
the aforesaid sandwiches, which seem
well named at such times. A brisk wind
slaps it into your eye or your mouth
in disconcerting fashion, and you become
aware of its grating presence.
Then, again, there are clouds upon
the horizon. To those who are seriously
affected by the sand, these clouds
look ominous. They may forebode a
storm and a wetting. A certain clamminess
of hands and feet, occasioned by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span>
the bath, remind one that a change
in the weather precedes a cold in the
head. These feelings mark the man
of creature comforts and he fails to
join in the part-singing which comes
after the hearty meal, when pipes are
lighted and the entire gathering stretch
themselves upon the sands for a
lazy half-hour before the inevitable
cleaning-up process begins. This same
individual declines to tell his best story,
and should a ball game be suggested,
he will be found callous to all coaxing.
He has enough sand in his shoes
as it is, or he has eaten too much for
exercising, or possibly the clouds on
the horizon lower more formidably.</p>

<p>Yes, a picnic discloses the strength<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span>
and weakness of character which mark
our friends, and yet, after all, it does
more, for it brings out the best in
most of us, and few, even of our habitually
conventional friends, fail to
respond to the delights of a seashore
picnic or lack in the essential philosophy
of an outdoor, care-free existence.</p>

<span class="smaller">MODELS</span></h2>

</div>

<p>Long before the Old Colony Railroad
thought of running a line to Cape Cod—although
that in itself was not so
very long ago, well within the memory
of man—there was one charm of
the Cape which is fast vanishing and
entirely unknown to the casual visitor
and unappreciated by the perennial
summer residents. In those days there<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span>
was a host of rugged, sturdy men,
intelligent, courageous, upright, and
keen-minded. They were the Cape
captains, the men who grew up among
the sand-dunes, to the rote of the sea.
The men who carried the good name
of Cape Cod to the ends of the earth
and who brought back with them the
fortunes which made the little towns,
dotted here and there along the shore,
havens of comfort and rest.</p>

<p>Such men could tell stories which
would vie with those of Conrad and
Stevenson, but for the most part their
deeds go unrecorded except in their
ships’ logs, for they were a simple,
reserved company. Of this epoch
there remains but one relic which is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>
sought after by the present generation,
and it savors of the antique. In
fact, it is the antiquarian rather than
the adventurer who ransacks the Cape
at present for ships’ models.</p>

<p>In those early days there were
months at a time when the ship’s
company were idle, and it grew to be
a custom for those clever with their
hands to fashion models of the schooners
in which they sailed or of seacraft
notable for beauty of line or complexity
of rig.</p>

<p>Many an old sea captain would pass
his idle moments in fashioning these
miniature boats, and many members
of the ships’ crews became adept at
the hobby, for a knowledge of tools<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span>
was almost an essential for every man
on the Cape, where the trades of
carpenter, painter, and plumber were
generally performed by the householder.
Furthermore, a sailor would
infinitely prefer to whittle out a model
than to swab down the deck, and frequently
a clever mechanic would be
relieved by his captain from this menial
work, if he devoted his time to the
perfection of a model which was destined
for the mantel of the captain’s
best parlor.</p>

<p>Therefore, in the old days, there
was scarcely a Cape family of saltwater
ancestry which did not boast of
at least one model and often more, the
trademark of an honorable and hazardous<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span>
occupation and a relic of former
days of plenty when the Cape was
peopled only by the native Cape-Codders
and before steam took from them
the vocation to which they were reared.</p>

<p>To-day the captain of a full-rigged
ship is as hard to find as the vessel
herself, and the Cape exists upon
the summer residents and upon the
less productive occupation of fishing,
which is largely in the hands of the
Portuguese, who have come in droves
to settle upon our land of Bartholomew
Gosnold and his company of adventurers.
And so the interest in ships and
in tales of the sea has disappeared
along with those who upheld the trade;
and the models, familiar sights to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span>
descendants, have been relegated to
the attic or have been sold as curiosities
to the ubiquitous dealers in antiques,
who persistently come to the
Cape for old furniture, pewter, china—anything,
in fact, which can be
palmed off on that voracious type of
collector, the lover of antiques.</p>

<p>During the last few years, for some
reason or other, these models have
become very popular. Just why it is
not easy to explain. It is true that they
typify a lost trade which was full of
adventure. It is also true that they are
decorative, many of them, but that
hardly explains the ravenous appetite
which many collectors of antiques have
recently developed to obtain a genuine<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span>
model. Dealers have secured agents
in every town on the Cape who are
ransacking their neighborhoods for
models, half-models, pictures of boats
made in bas-reliefs, weather vanes in
the shape of ships, and the prices are
increasing by leaps and bounds. In
fact, so popular has this fad become
that ex-sailors and carpenters with
some slight acquaintance with the sea
are now developing quite a business in
fashioning models of special designs
or of former famous ships. A few
years ago the model of a schooner
about two feet in length fully rigged
would bring in the neighborhood of
twenty-five dollars; to-day the same
model could not be secured for less<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span>
than one hundred dollars. Often the
smaller, more exquisitely made specimens
will bring more. The descendants
of the old captains have lost any
sentimental regard for these relics and
gladly part with them for a comparatively
small sum, but only to the patient
and skillful, who know Cape
ways and Cape people, and so it is
almost impossible for the tourist to
secure a model except from a dealer.</p>

<p>Should the casual summer visitor
attempt to bargain with his native
Cape neighbor, he would find him a
wily bird, suspicious of being imposed
upon and as likely as not to put an
absurd valuation upon his possession;
and yet that same Cape neighbor<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span>
might part with the model the next
day to a total stranger for a smaller
sum, for such is the nature of the
denizen of the Cape. This contrary-mindedness
and disinclination to do a
favor is not unusual, but as against this
trait, he will be found to be a genial
host and a kindly acquaintance often
generous beyond his means.</p>

<p>And so to-day we witness the passing
of the models, last relic of the
olden days, the golden days of Cape
Cod, from those tiny Cape cottages
built by these same sturdy sea captains
to the comfortable mansions of the
summer people whose knowledge of
the sea is secured in July and August
by an occasional dip, a sail in a knockabout,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span>
and a glimpse of a glorious sunset
over the shining waters of the
Atlantic Ocean.</p>

<span class="smaller">“A WET SHEET AND A FLOWING SEA”</span></h2>

</div>

<p>In my youthful days I often wondered
at the regularity with which elderly
people would go out to drive day after
day, sitting in the same seat in the same
carriage, behind the same horses, driven
by the same coachman along the same
roads. It seemed to me a lamentable
waste of time. And now I have more
or less (less as the years advance) the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span>
same feeling toward those couples
whose chief relaxation is a spin along
the state roads of their district in a
well-appointed limousine, for I belong
to that class of motorists who use their
cars purely for convenience and prefer
the fresh-air variety.</p>

<p>Yet, when it comes to sailing, for
some reason which I am at a loss to
explain, my views are diametrically
opposite. I am content to clamber
into my knockabout and to perform
the routine labor of pumping “her”
out, unfurling and hoisting the sail,
and casting off, then to cruise lazily
about our harbor, sailing over the
same course day in and day out with
little variation, and to do this either<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span>
alone or with a kindred spirit as the
case may be.</p>

<p>To many these cases may seem parallel,
but to me they are widely variant.
There is a formality to a drive or a
motor ride which starts with the costume
worn and ends with the character
of conversation.</p>

<p>On a boat—and I am speaking entirely
of small boats—the costume
is of a heterogeneous variety and the
conversation of the freest. In fact,
there is something so thoroughly unconventional
about life on the water
that even the stiffest of Brahminian
Bostonians may occasionally be heard
to indulge in slang and to assume a
rakish attitude, perched upon deck.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span></p>

<p>But such criticism, or rather comparison,
is highly superficial. There is
more to it than external appearance;
for sailing brings out the best in human
nature, encourages philosophy, develops
independence of thought and act,
and largely so because those who sail
shed their coating of reserve and allow
their natural feelings fair play. There
is no quicker way to know and size up
one’s friends than to go on a cruise for
a few days. There is no better way of
enjoying and extending one’s friendships
with both sexes than spending
a few afternoons sailing together, skirting
along the shore with a fair breeze,
nor is there any quicker way of learning
the weaknesses of certain individuals<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span>
than by observing their conduct
under perhaps less peaceful conditions
at sea. For the best of skippers
cannot predict weather conditions, and
there are times when wind and storm
will come upon one with surprising
quickness.</p>

<p>Here in New England, the sailing
fraternity may be divided into those
who prefer the Maine coast and those
who cling to the Cape and Buzzard’s
Bay. As one of the latter class, I always
claim our supremacy by stating two
points which I believe to be true: first,
that we have more wind, and second,
that we have less fog. To me this is
convincing. The southwest wind which
cools the Cape, blows nearly every day<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span>
in summer and with a strength that
often requires reefing. Rarely between
ten in the morning and five at night
will the mariner find himself becalmed
in Buzzard’s Bay. In fact, the
stranger is generally amazed to see
girls and young boys sailing without
the presence of an older person, in what
looks to him a three-reef breeze.</p>

<p>They have been brought up to it
and realize that vigilance must always
be exercised on the water, and they
know the qualities of their boat and the
power of the wind. I know of no better
training for youngsters who are proficient
in swimming than to learn to
sail and race their own little boats. The
development of a power of observation,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span>
accurate judgment, prompt action,
and steady nerve comes more quickly
with the handling of a boat than in any
other way for those who lead our kind
of life.</p>

<p>Sailing is confined to boats, but boats
are not by any means confined to sailing,
for latterly there are almost as
many motor-boats to be found chugging
along the shores of the Cape as
there are sailboats, although I personally
always pity the groups in the stern
of one of these modern affairs which
makes its noisy passage leaving an
odorous wake of oil and smoke. But
doubtless I am extreme in my views
and old-fashioned in my taste.</p>

<p>Give me a knockabout—a fifteen-footer<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span>
for real comfort for a daily sail,
a stiff member of the twenty-one-foot
class for cruising along shore. Give me
a comfortable catboat, broad of beam,
for a family boat or for a day’s fishing,
or let me idle about in one of our little
twelve-foot Herreshoff class with my
small son. In any one of them I shall
find the same sense of freedom, the
same sort of pleasure, and the same
love for the salt sea, and from each I
shall look at the windy, sandy shores of
the Cape with the same loyal affection.</p>

<span class="smaller">MY CAPE FARM</span></h2>

</div>

<p>If I have thought of it at all, I have
thought of myself as a sociable cuss.
Not that I like sociables; I hate them,
and that is probably why they have
gone out of fashion. What to my
mind defines sociability is the quality
of enjoying and giving enjoyment to
others, singly, in pairs, or in groups;
and in present days sociability is generally<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span>
put to the test either at dinners
or at week-end parties, for these are
the principal points of contact between
friends.</p>

<p>Latterly, however, my social bent
has been somewhat warped by the
growing desire on the part of my
friends to boast of their success as
producers of food. Whether it be premature
senility, the result of conservation,
or merely the acquisition of
wealth, which is being rapidly returned
to its own through the purchase of
land and the ingenuity of gardeners,
it is a fact that at dinners of the cut-and-dried
variety or a family gathering,
or, more especially, over a week-end,
my host invariably calls attention<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span>
to the asparagus with a modest cough
as prelude, or my hostess mentions
the number of eggs the farmer brought
in yesterday to be put down in water-glass.
Sometimes it is not asparagus,
but peas, or corn, or perhaps a chicken,
or even a ham. This the host. His
wife more generally dilates upon the
milk products and the preserving end
of the bill of fare; but, for whatever
cause, the thing got a bit on my
nerves, so that I found myself thinking
of reasons for not visiting So-and-So
or for not dining with the Thing-um-Bobs
on Friday week, when I
knew we hadn’t a thing on earth
to do.</p>

<p>This frame of mind was, of course,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span>
all wrong. In the first place, these
friends were as good and as loyal as
they were ten years ago, when, if
they had any garden at all, it consisted
of a half-dozen radishes that no
one could eat without summoning a
physician within four hours. Furthermore,
the aforesaid asparagus, with its
accompaniments, was better than the
ordinary variety which has decorated
the entrance to the greengrocer’s establishment
for the better part of a week.
And lastly, as I had no garden myself,
why not enjoy the best and be
thankful?</p>

<p>Probably the reason was envy and
the season spring, when, contrary to
budding nature, one’s own physical<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span>
being is not as blooming as it should
be.</p>

<p>Be this as it may, the final result
has probably made me more of a bore
to my friends than they ever were to
me, for to get even with them I conceived
the happy idea of catering to
their epicurean tastes from my own
farm, which consisted of a scant two
acres of shore line in that section of
Cape Cod which is renowned for its
scarcity of soil.</p>

<p>The idea came to me soon after we
had moved down for the summer
months, and my wife became so enthusiastic
that it really became our
hobby for the season. We had planned
for a succession of week-ends, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span>
many of these agricultural intimates
were coming to us for return visits.
We would feed them upon the fat of
our land or in this case largely the fat
of the sea.</p>

<p>It is interesting and instructive to
learn just what varieties of food can
be secured from the immediate vicinity
of any place, and to me especially
so of our Cape Cod.</p>

<p>During the entire summer I felt so
personal an interest in our section of
the country that my small son exclaimed
one day that I talked as if I
owned the entire Cape. I know I felt
a proprietary interest in certain fishing
grounds, the whereabouts of which
I would not confess even on the rack.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span>
And it amuses me now to think of
the circuitous routes I used in getting
to certain berry patches and stretches
where mushrooms grew overnight.
In variety our dinners, or high teas
(as we always called them), were infinite
as compared with those of our
asparagus associates.</p>

<p>I remember one little repast which
pleased me mightily, because it came
at the end of one of those hot days—they
are rare on the Cape—when the
wind refused to blow from the southwest.
We had had our swim, but even
golf was a bit too strenuous and food
does not have its usual appeal on such
occasions even on the Cape. It also
happened that our friends of this particular<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span>
week-end were literally congested
with land and its more generous
offerings, and so when I practiced the
usual humiliatory cough and remarked
that our simple repast came from my
Cape farm and they must excuse its
simplicity, I was just a trifle nervous.</p>

<p>The melons were a gift from my
plumber, a curious combination. If only
the plumber could plumb as well as
he grows melons upon his barren
sandpile, our summer comfort would
be increased by fifty per cent. No
better melons can be found than these
little fellows. The clam-broth, from
my own clam-bed, was an appetizer.
I seriously believe that there is real
energizing value in such clam-broth<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span>
as this, boiled down almost to a <i>liqueur</i>
from newly dug clams. Then came
scallops plucked that day from the
seaweed, where they lie at low tide
blowing like miniature whales. We
all know how delicious they are in the
autumn served with <i>tartare</i> sauce, but
have you ever tasted them creamed
with a dash of brown sherry and served
with fresh mushrooms?</p>

<p>Just as the plumber supplies us
with melons, so the fishman is the
local authority on lettuce. Our salad,
therefore, came from Captain Barwick,
crisp and white with slices of early
pears from a near-by tree, and with it
my favorite muffins of coarse, white
cornmeal toasted, thin, and eaten with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span>
beach-plum jam made from our own
bushes in the bramble patch close by
the lane, and cottage cheese which
our cook positively enjoys making.</p>

<p>My wife had felt this to be a rather
scant repast for those used to dinners
of six or eight courses, and so the
dessert was a substantial huckleberry
pudding served cold from the ice-chest
with whipped cream, and to take
the chill off we had a small glass of
my home-made wild-cherry brandy
with our coffee; and while there are
other beverages which are preferable
I confess it gave us a delightfully
comforting sensation.</p>

<p>The hearty, genuine praise from
my guests gave me a fleeting feeling<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span>
of shame at the way I had criticized
their asparagus and numberless eggs,
but the pride of success carried me
with it.</p>

<p>“Oh, this is not anything; wait until
to-morrow and let me show you the
varieties which my farm offers. In the
catboat, I have a well in which we
keep fish alive. What say you to a
butterfish for breakfast? For dinner
we can either go out to the fishing
grounds for something with a real
pull to it, or we can motor over to
Turtle Pond for a try at a bass, or we
can golf and take a couple of lobsters
out of my pots bobbing up and down
out there by the point.”</p>

<p>“Hold on,” my friend interjected.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span>
“What I want to know is whether
every one on the Cape lives in this
way, for if they do I think I shall be
moving down here by another season.”</p>

<p>“No,” I replied, “very few. In the
first place, most people continue to do
just what their neighbors do—tennis,
golf, swimming, sailing. The fishing
is poor unless you know where to go.
The natives are not helpful unless you
know how to take them, and that is
why I call it all <i>my</i> farm, because I
have taken it all unto myself and I
reap a reward much richer than I deserve.</p>

<p>“I pass much of my time hunting
up new fishing grounds or the lair of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span>
the soft-shell crab, or even the quiet,
muddy recesses of the ‘little necks.’
I wander about the country exploring
new berry patches, for there is a great
variety of these. And if you must
know, I fraternize with certain delightfully
conversational individuals who
sell me delicious fruit and vegetables
as well as ducks and chickens and a
variety of odds and ends, as, for instance,
that little model over there. But you
could not buy them. No, sir, not until
you learned the art of negotiation to
perfection. You may manage your
estates to the Queen’s taste, but when
it comes to managing a Cape-Codder,
ah, that’s not done so easily.”</p>

<p>I see my friends leading the conventional<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span>
summer life and wonder at
times how they can come to the Cape
year after year and yet be strangers
to its real fascination, because it has
many other hidden allurements besides
this quest for food.</p>

<span class="smaller">SCALLOPS</span></h2>

</div>

<p>Sport, according to our highest authorities,
is “that which diverts and
makes mirth,” and from this general
interpretation the term has been applied
to games, and to the various
forms of hunting and fishing commonly
known, but I have yet to hear
the word applied to the pursuit of the
scallop. And yet, scalloping more<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span>
nearly approaches the original meaning
of sport than most of the games
which are commonly classed under
this heading, for not only does the
scallop divert and provoke the mirth
of his pursuer, but the pursuer in turn
evokes a similar feeling and impression
upon those who chance to see him
in action. Those who have never tasted
the joys and excitement of a scallop
hunt have not completed their education
as real sportsmen. It is true that
Badminton does not devote a volume
to this particular pastime; it is equally
true that the progressive American
journalist, whose duty it is to supply
the sporting columns of his paper with
all the news of current athletic events,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span>
invariably ignores this important item,
and our mighty Nimrods fail to include
scalloping among their feats of
prowess; but in each case the cause
of the omission invariably can be traced
to ignorance, and to the fact that your
scallop-hunter is a wary fellow who
says but little and boasts less, fearing
inadvertently to disclose the favored
haunts of his favorite prey. And so,
for these and divers causes, the pursuit
of the scallop lies in obscurity.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the scallop has
been a friend to man for generations
in many and varied ways. In the days
of the Crusaders, the pilgrims returning
from the Holy Land wore scallop
shells, gathered upon the coast of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[157]</span>
Palestine, as a badge or mark of the
success of their wanderings. At an
equally early period the scallop shell
became an important factor in design,
from architecture, through the various
stages, to the adornment of women’s
clothes. The scallop shell is discovered
embedded in the capitals of many
famous columns. It will be found
chiseled upon the keystones of countless
arches. Scarcely a theater but
possesses it among its mural decorations.
Upon the title-pages of books
it serves in an equally decorative capacity,
while the scalloping upon the
hems of dresses brings the scallop’s
shell familiarly into our family life.</p>

<p>In addition to all this, certain families<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span>
of ancient lineage have adopted
the shell as a part of their crest. Heraldry
traces the cause to the days of
the Knights of the Holy Land.</p>

<p>The scallop, therefore, has been
sought by generations, and is no marine
upstart basing his claims to popularity
upon his flavor as a savory dish
for a modern Lucullus. In short, the
scallop is historic, artistic, decorative,
and delicious. In real life, however,
he is one of the numerous marine bivalve
mollusks of the genus <i>Pecten</i>,
and to those who have not already
recognized the symmetrically ribbed
shells so often found upon our beaches,
a dictionary is recommended.</p>

<p>Although his past is buried in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span>
annals of the Holy Land, in Ægean
waters, and upon the banks of the
Red Sea, just at present he is rampant
upon the shoals of Cape Cod, and it
is here that our scallopers pursue him
during the weeks previous to early
autumn days, when the Cape fisherman
wages destruction with sea-rakes,
seines, and nets.</p>

<p>Imagine the tide running low, disclosing
the bright, sandy bottoms of
countless inlets, the ripple of the waters
making dim the outlines of the
corrugated surfaces of the submerged
shore. At such times, and in certain
localities which shall be nameless,
the wily hunter issues forth in bathing-suit
or rubber-booted, or even—in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[160]</span>
the enthusiasm of the moment—fully
clothed, with pail or basket sometimes
attached to his waist by a cord.
He wades in at a slow pace, gazing
searchingly into the depths of the
water for a sign of his prey, choosing
at first the shoals where it is easier to
see, and as likely a spot as others for
fine shellfish. And here a curious phenomenon
is discovered; his eye catches
the glint of a shining shell and he
stoops to secure it, only to find a half
shell without life. The brighter the
shell, the less chance of its being inhabited.
The scallop covers himself
when possible with a few strands of
seaweed, or buries himself in the mud
or sand, and therefore, when in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span>
full bloom of life, he looks like a
hoary, hairy thing of past history, an
encrusted shell from which life might
have departed a century ago. If, by
good fortune, the hand comes in contact
with him, however, his vitality is
made quickly evident by a savage snap
of his shell, as the large muscle expands
and contracts in self-defense,
and should a finger become caught
between the upper and lower shells,
the hunter is in for a sharp nip. The
quest leads from spot to spot, from
shoal water out into deeper parts,
until one finds one’s self waist-deep,
bending and stooping, raking the bottom
with frenzied hand groping for
these tufted prizes, and when one is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span>
fortunate to secure a good spot, the
hand never fails to bring up one, two,
and sometimes more, of these irate
creatures whose antics evoke admiration
and whose strength seems almost
abnormal.</p>

<p>There are bright, warm days in the
latter part of August when on many
parts of the shore may be seen men,
women, and children by scores, curiously
and wonderfully garbed, grotesquely
postured, wading the waters
in this fascinating pursuit, which, after
the quiet glamor of clam-digging,
possesses the excitement of big-game
hunting. Were it not for a strict law
these same hardy hunters would, undoubtedly,
be found in dories, plying<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span>
a small net for the same purpose, but
the very crudity of the chase has its
advantages, for one comes close to the
life of the sea bottom, and all that
goes on there, from the waving masses
of seaweed of many varieties to the
countless forms of life clinging to the
rocks, embedded in the mud or darting
through the water. The sea bottom
is as busy as Broadway, and as
full of mystery.</p>

<p>The reader must not for a moment
imagine the scallop, however, as belonging
to a sedentary type of life.
Often he is found moving at a high
rate of speed through the water, propelled
by this same muscle which
provides his defense. By opening and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span>
closing his shell he moves forward
and upward or downward, apparently
at will, digging himself into the mud
and effectually hiding himself from
his pursuers. He deserves the respect
of his superiors in the animal kingdom,
and at the same time proves
himself fair game by his prowess.</p>

<p>And so one is led out and out still
farther, until, bent upon securing one
more victim, a mouthful of water and
smarting eyes give notice that those
beyond are safe for the time being,
and the successful hunter returns to
his boat with a full pail, while the
sun, enormous and a deep orange red,
is just touching the horizon.</p>

<p>The conquest is not complete, for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[165]</span>
it is no easy task to open these snapping
bivalves, and thus to extract the
muscle that is the edible portion, and
the full reward is by no means reaped.
That is left for the evening meal,
when the scallop becomes the <i>pièce de
résistance</i> cooked in one of a hundred
ways. But of this let a <i>cordon bleu</i>
convince you, whose best efforts are
secured and deserved by the scallop.</p>

<p>And now comes the fall of the year
with days gorgeous in coloring, from
the clear crystal blue of the sky reflected
in sparkling waters to the
flame-tinted stretches of woodland
watched over by tall pines and guarded
by stately cedars. The sandy roads glisten
in the distances, marking off sections
of the Cape country as a huge
picture puzzle. The atmosphere seems
purged of all imperfection, giving to
every town and hamlet a spotless appearance
bright with late flowers and
fresh fruit awaiting the harvest. Azure
days of October, the most perfect of the
year. It is then that regretfully we say
“au revoir” to our beloved Cape in all
its glory.</p>
